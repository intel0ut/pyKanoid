# pyKanoid
A Python version of the beloved Arkanoid game, using the [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/) library. This was a weekend project to learn about gaming develpment using Pygame. It's full of bugs and probably will never be completed, but it's fun to play.

# installation
pip install -r requirements.txt
then
python pykanoid.py
